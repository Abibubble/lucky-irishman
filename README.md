This is a drinking game site designed for people to be able to celebrate St. Patrick's Day together whilst apart.
It is designed to be responsive on a wide range of devices, whilst also being easy to navigate through. 
This was built as part of Code Institute's March 2021 Hackathon, with the theme of 'Hacking St. Patrick's Day'.

## User Experience (UX)
### Initial Discussion
We wanted this project to be an easy way for people to celebrate St. Patrick's Day together, whilst kept apart due to Coronavirus. It is designed to be playable over video 
conferencing, so people can still have drinks together and celebrate St. Patrick's Day whilst staying safe.

### User Stories

* For a user to be able to play a drinking game with friends or family.
* For a user to feel like they're celebrating St. Patrick's Day whilst Coronavirus restrictions are in place.

#### First Time Visitor Goals
* To be able to play a drinking game with a friend via video conferencing.
* Easy to navigate around the site.
* Clear and simple to understand instructions.

#### Returning Visitor Goals
* To be able to replay the game, and not have the same game experience.
* To be able to easily access medical advice if the situation required.

#### Frequent Visitor Goals

## Design
### Color Scheme
* The colors used were shades of green, yellow and black, to link with the St. Patrick's Day theme.

### Typography
* The font 'Architect's Daughter' was used, as it's a relaxed font, which links with the theme of drinking.
* The font was imported from Google Fonts, so it should function at all times that Google is functioning.

### Imagery
* All images used relate to either shamrock, lucky clovers, St. Patrick's Day, or the theme of the cards.
* The favicon is included to tie the site to the theme from the moment they load the page.
* The site, 'Lucky Irishman', is named after a well-known Irish cocktail, adding more links to St. Patrick's Day, which is often celebrated with drinking Irish-themed drinks.

### Wireframes
[Here are the wireframes for desktop, mobile, and tablet for this project](assets/docs/hackathon.pdf).

### Features
* A flipping card that rotates to show the next drinking challenge.
* A link to connect you to Drink Aware.
* A reminder to drink responsibly on every page.
* An age requirement.
* Audio toggle on / off.
* A favicon to add to the theme of the site.

### Audio
* An audio file of Irish music is included if the user clicks the audio icon button.
* This button toggles on or off, depending on the current state of the audio.
* This audio adds to the theming of St. Patrick's Day.

## Testing
### W3C Validator
The W3C Markup Validator, W3C CSS Validator, and JSHint were used to validate the project to ensure there were no syntax errors within the site. 
The errors brought up by the W3C HTML Validator are due to the fact that we have a FontAwesome icon in front of our header, causing it to read the code as without a heading in that section. 
The errors brought up by W3C CSS Validator were all related to Bootstrap.

##### For a user to feel like they're celebrating St. Patrick's Day whilst Coronavirus restrictions are in place.
* The entire site is themed to St. Patrick's Day.
* The game is able to be played over video conferencing, so people can still play together, whilst not being physically together.

#### First Time Visitor Goals
##### To be able to play a drinking game with a friend via video conferencing.
* This game is easy to play over video conferencing using a screen share function.

##### Clear and simple to understand instructions.
* The instructions are laid out in the center of the page after you click the first button to get the game started.
* There is also an age restriction warning to instruct those under the legal drinking age not to play.

#### Returning Visitor Goals
##### To be able to replay the game, and not have the same game experience.
* All cards are presented in a randomized order, so the game won't be the same each time.

##### To be able to easily access medical advice if the situation required.
* On the bottom of every page, in the footer, there is a link to emergency numbers.

### Further Testing
The website was tested on Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Safari, and Samsung Internet browsers.
The website was viewed on a variety of devices, including:
* Acer Aspire V Nitro Laptop, running Windows 10
* Lenovo B51 IntelCore i7 Laptop, running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
* OPPO Find X2 Lite
* Samsung Galaxy A70
* Samsung Galaxy S9
* Samsung A20
* XBox One

A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were visible or hidden correctly, all buttons worked as they should, and the quiz played out as it should.
Friends and other developers were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues that they came across.

### Solved Bugs
1. Introduction page responsive design in y-axis wasn't working below 1300px viewport width.
    * We checked our modified styling, to ensure that none of those had affected the Bootstrap classes we are using.
    * We checked the version of Bootstrap that we were using was the correct version for the features we wanted.
    * We checked the function of the Bootstrap classes we were using.
    * We discovered our footer was not taking up the required width, due to it being located inside another container-fluid div.
    * We took it out of that container, to give us more control over our footer.
    * We discovered a display: flex in our body styling, which was messing with our footer styles, so we removed it.

2. None of our margins were working as expected.
    * We checked the parent properties of all elements to find out which one was giving us margin issues.
    * We discovered that our Bootstrap classes were adding strange margins to our code.
    * We set the pages class to be 100vw and 100vh, which gave us the full screen to use.

3. Our footer was too big on mobile devices.
    * We set our names column in the footer to hide on small screen sizes using sm-none Bootstrap class.
    * This removed all of the text from our site.
    * We realized we needed to show the names column from medium screen size and above, so added the correct Bootstrap classes.
    * We then used media queries to correct the last little bits of styling.

4. The navigation function wasn't working on the 'Let's get drinking' button.
    * We checked if we needed this.id in our onclick function.
    * We found that we only needed id, so changed that, but the function still wasn't working.
    * We double-checked our code and realised we hadn't included the pages class in all page sections.
    * We added that class and fixed this bug.

5. The audio wasn't playing when the audio button was clicked.
    * We checked the pathways to the audio file, but all was correct.
    * We read through each line of our audio functions, and corrected 'audio' to 'irishAudio'.
    * This still didn't solve the issue, so we checked inside the HTML.
    * We'd called 'ToggleMusicFunction' instead of 'ToggleMusic', which we corrected to fix this bug.

6. The 'Next Card' button was positioned behind the card.
    * We put the button element inside a div with .col-12 to position it underneath the image.
    * This put the button on top of the image.
    * We looked at Google DevTools, and saw that the button was inside a section that wasn't the full size of the viewport.
    * We gave that section height of 100vh.
    * We then set the button to position: fixed and set it to the place we wanted, which solved our bug.
    * We then also decided we didn't want a 'Next Card' button, so removed it.

7. The clicking on the card wasn't giving us a new card.
    * We were just using cardPopulate function, which didn't flip the card to the card background.
    * We created a new function nextFlip, which is called flipCard and cardPopulate functions.
    * This gave us a lot of console errors.
    * We then looked at how the function was being called and realised we needed a setTimeout.
    * We set this to delay the flip and populate functions, which solved our bug.

### Known Bugs
* None found

### Lighthouse
We tested our website using the DevTools Lighthouse feature, and got these results:

#### Desktop
![Lighthouse desktop](assets/docs/lighthousedesktop.png)

#### Mobile
![Lighthouse mobile](assets/docs/lighthousemobile.png)

#### Performance:
* We used images that were sized correctly as much as possible.
* We used the most recent version of Bootstrap.
* The only thing we lost the score for here was some unused CSS on the mobile site (which is used on the desktop site).

#### Accessibility:
* We ensured all images had alt text attached.
* We made sure all colors had sufficient color contrast to not cause issues for any colorblind users.
* We made sure all fonts were large enough to not cause issues for anyone with impaired sight.

#### Best Practices:
* All best practices were followed to our best abilities.

#### SEO:
* Meta description and keywords were included for best SEO practice.
