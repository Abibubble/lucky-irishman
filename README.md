[Here is a link to the final project](https://shamrocked.github.io/lucky-irishman)

This is a drinking game site designed for people to be able to celebrate St. Patrick's Day together whilst apart.
It is designed to be responsive on a wide range of devices, whilst also being easy to navigate through. 
This was built as part of Code Institute's March 2021 Hackathon, with the theme of 'Hacking St. Patrick's Day'.

## User Experience (UX)
### Initial Discussion
We wanted this project to be an easy way for people to celebrate St. Patrick's Day together, whilst kept apart due to Coronavirus. It is designed to be playable over video 
conferencing, so people can still have drinks together and celebrate St. Patrick's Day whilst staying safe.

### User Stories
#### Client Goals
* For a user to be able to play a drinking game with friends or family.
* For a user to feel like they're celebrating St. Patrick's Day whilst Coronavirus restrictions are in place.

#### First Time Visitor Goals
* To be able to play a drinking game with a friend via video conferencing.
* Easy to navigate around the site.
* Clear and simple to understand instructions.

#### Returning Visitor Goals
* To be able to replay the game, and not have the same game experience.
* To be able to easily access medical advice if the situation required.

#### Frequent Visitor Goals
* To be able to replay the game, and not have the same game experience.
* To be able to easily access medical advice if the situation required.

## Design
### Color Scheme
* The colors used were shades of green, yellow and black, to link with the St. Patrick's Day theme.

### Typography
* The font 'Architect's Daughter' was used, as it's a relaxed font, which links with the theme of drinking.
* The font was imported from Google Fonts, so it should function at all times that Google is functioning.

### Imagery
* All images used relate to either shamrocks, lucky clovers, St. Patrick's Day, or the theme of the cards.

### Wireframes
[Here are the wireframes for desktop, mobile and tablet for this project](assets/docs/hackathon.pdf).

### Features
* A flipping card that rotates to show the next drinking challenge.
* A link to connect you to emergency help.
* A reminder to drink responsibly on every page.
* An age requirement.

##### For a user to feel like they're celebrating St. Patrick's Day whilst Coronavirus restrictions are in place.
* The entire site is themed to St. Patrick's Day.

* There is also an age restriction warning to instruct those under the legal drinking age not to play.

#### Returning Visitor Goals

A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were visible or hidden correctly, all buttons worked as they should, and the quiz played out as it should.
Friends, family members, and other developers were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues that they came across.

### Solved Bugs
1. Introduction page responsive design in y-axis wasn't working below 1300px viewportwidth.
    * We checked our modified styling, to ensure that none of those had affected the Bootstrap classes we are using.
    * We checked the version of Bootstrap that we were using was the correct version for the features we wanted.
    * We checked function of the Bootstrap classes we were using.
    * We discovered our footer was not taking up the required width, due to it being located inside another container-fluid div.
    * We took it out of that container, to give us more control over our footer.
    * We discovered a display: flex in our body styling, which was messing with our footer styles, so we removed it.

2. The background image wasn't responsive below 1300px.
    * We hadn't used no-repeat, fixed on our background, so we added that in.
    * That unfortunately removed our background completely.
    * We tried writing background-repeat: no-repeat on a seperate line, which stopped our background repeating.
    * We then added background-size: cover, but that didn't fix our problem.

3. Our footer was too big on mobile devices.
    * We set our names column in the footer to hide on small screen sizes using sm-none Bootstrap class.
    * This removed all of the text from our site.
    * We realised we needed to show the names column from medium screen size and above, so added the correct Bootstrap classes.
    * We then used media queries to correct the last little bits of styling.

4. The navigation function wasn't working on the 'Let's get drinking' button.
    * We checked if we needed this.id in our onclick function.
    * We found that we only needed id, so changed that, but the function still wasn't working.
    * We double checked our code, and realised we hadn't included the pages class to all page sections.
    * We added that class, and fixed this bug.

### Known Bugs
